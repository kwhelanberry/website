When learning is deliberately connected to key foundations of human flourishing it becomes supercharged, creating more meaningful immediate and long-term practicing and living of the learning.

One of the greatest joys and challenges of being a teacher/trainer is turning inspiration into action, especially beyond the formal learning experience. While experiential and embodied teaching/learning approaches continue to grow, the challenges persist of building from new knowledge to meaningful practices that integrate learning.  

Positive Psychology identifies key foundations for flourishing:  meaning and purpose, awareness of the mind/body connection, positive relationships and emotions, and engaging character strengths.  When learning design and delivery incorporates these cornerstones, a framework emerges that goes beyond experiential and embodied learning.

We call this framework LEAP, which:

1. Leverages balance of body, soul and mind in the learning experience,
2. Engages reflection to integrate learning for the individual, their relationships and contexts,
3. Acknowledges relationships between the learning and strengths, and positive emotions and outcomes, and
4. Promotes practice in the immediate learning moment and beyond.

Research on LEAP training/course experiences shows changes in individual and workplace outcomes (such as, but not limited to Subjective Happiness, Life Satisfaction, Work Satisfaction, Organizational Commitment, and Perceived Strength of Key Interpersonal Skills â€“ e.g., Leadership, Teamwork, Communication)

Do you need help understanding and using your strengths?

Do you feel overwhelmed or stuck?

Do you know what you want to do, but have trouble making it happen?

Do you find yourself running out of energy?

Do you feel life is passing you by?

I really appreciate the observation of one of my teachers that we can’t simply think our way to a different behavior.  If we could, we would all buy one “how-to” book and be done.  It takes practice and embodiment. Embodiment means learning is linked to:

- the whole person – body, soul, and mind,
- why and how that learning impacts you and your life and work.

My coaching:
- Creates learning and insight that walks out the door, or, is used immediately,  
- Raises your level of excellence (you know what excellence means for in your life and work),
- Builds habits that work for you – best practices and science provide a framework and we discover what works for you,
- Develops resilience for challenging and difficult time.  

Coaching is typically one-on-one, and completed in hourly sessions.  I use a positive psychology model of coaching, and coaching can be short term – as short as four to six weeks, or can be longer term.  Coaching can focus on personal and or professional goals. As noted above, in each coaching session we will focus on building your capabilities and capacity, and practice, or your relevant habits and routines, and ways of thinking.

Would you like to . . .

change or strengthen performance excellence for yourself, your employees, or team?  

have or observe in others greater resilience during challenging times and projects?

develop greater abilities for individual, team, and organizational change?

create training for behavior change, as opposed to for knowing what needs to change?


My consulting:  
- enhances employee and team performance excellence,
- creates conditions for high performance, positive teams and related dynamics,
- facilitates organizational change, and the inherent individual/employee change,
- develops abilities for managing work-life balance/integration and wellbeing.

Too much corporate consulting and training remains in the conference room or only as an interesting thought for the participants.  Instead, I focus on how will be different, beginning the next day and going forward.  I also inherently incorporate individual and team wellbeing, as wellbeing leads to higher motivation, satisfaction, and commitment.  

I have worked for the past five years in learning/training design and delivery that cultivates immediate and long-term skills and habits.  I am the co-founder of the LEAP Learning Design and Delivery Model [link], and design training/courses, teach/lead courses, and also train-the-trainer. I have courses on individual and team excellence and resilience, organizational change, work-life balance and integration, and a variety of positive psychology and positive organizational psychology topics.  

I have colleagues with whom I collaborate frequently, and a larger community I can draw on for their expertise to best serve client needs.  If I do not feel I can effectively meet your goals, I am happy to refer you to others with the particular expertise you need.
